>3-Confusing-Things
1. When does index become useful in real life?
2. When using charAt, do I have to use "let word" right before console.logging charAt to establish which word I want it to interpret? Or can I ask it to charAt something from the earlier code?
3. Is .length the one that allows shopping websites to show their users how many products they have?

>3-Solid-Understandings
1. Array is a fast and easy way to lay out multiple data.
2. Index numbers don't represent quantity of things, it's just another way to count.
3. There are more than one ways to achieve your goal through coding, you can pick whichever one suits you and the situation best.
